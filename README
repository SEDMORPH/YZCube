This is the README for the SEDM2 code
=====================================

VW 14 July 2016

The code is run from sedm2_run.pro
Keywords need to be set for the code to do anything
/GASSFH = compute and store the gas and new star SFHs. This needs to be done before anything else will run. Currently only VW can run this, as the files are stored with the gadget-3 output. 
/CENTERSLIST = compute and store the centers of the two halos for all snapshots. This needs to be done before sdssimage, which use the centers to decide the image grids.
/SDSSIMAGE = compute SDSS-style images. Default is 1'. Use keyword IMAGESIZE to change this
/HYPERION = compute output files for hyperion
More options will be added soon. 

The Gadget-3 data is in /Users/vw8/data/SEDMORPH/SimnsGadget3/
The output from the code is currently set to go to  /Users/vw8/data/SEDMORPH/SimnsGadget3_output/

ALL directories should now be set in the sedm2_directories.inc file. This can then be stored locally to avoid the swapping of directories everytime a new version is pulled from bitbucket!



About branches:
> master       : Working on metallicity currently.
>BD_cell_spec  : Create cell spectra for bulge stars and Disk stars only.
		 This will need one more file and modification on sedm2_run but 		 we just need this function temporaily. So I create this branch 		 for this special use.(yrzheng 20-Aug-2018)
>test_spec_ind : Try to make the PCA function work --> Finished and has been mergered into master branch. Do not work on this branch any more!
> v2.0         : Finish checking SFH.
> v1.0.        : Can find centers of galaxies.
